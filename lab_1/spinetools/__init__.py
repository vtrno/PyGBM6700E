"""
SpineTools was built for the course GBM6700E at Polytechnique Montr√©al. It's meant to take over Matlab, which was used before, and provide easy access to Python tools for reading and processing the data. 

Modules :  
    - io : Handle inputs and outputs  
    - data : Process data structures  
    - render : Pretty 3D plots  
    - solver : Wrapper for the DLT (mainly)  
    - structures : Data structures for easy viz and management
